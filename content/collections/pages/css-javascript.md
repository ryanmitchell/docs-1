This guide is intended for apps adding CSS & JavaScript to the Control Panel. If you're building an addon, please see our [Vite Tooling](/addons/vite-tooling) guide instead.
:::

## Using Vite (recommended) {#using-vite}
[Vite](https://vite.dev) is the recommended frontend build tool in the Statamic and Laravel ecosystems. 

To set up Vite for the Control Panel, run the setup command:

```bash
php please setup-cp-vite
```

It will install the necessary dependencies, create a `vite-cp.config.js` file, and publish any necessary stubs.

You can add any CSS to the `resources/css/cp.css` file, and any JavaScript to the `resources/js/cp.js` file. 

To start Vite, run `npm run cp:dev` and to build for production, run `npm run cp:build`.

## Using `<script>` tags in the Control Panel

For externally-hosted scripts, you may register assets to be loaded in the Control Panel with the `externalScript` method. This method accepts the URL of an external script.


```php
use Statamic\Statamic;

class AppServiceProvider
{
    public function boot()
    {
        Statamic::externalScript('https://kit.fontawesome.com/5t4t4m1c.js');
    }
}
```

Otherwise, for inline scripts, you may use the `inlineScript` method. You should omit the `<script>` tags.

```php
use Statamic\Statamic;

class AppServiceProvider
{
    public function boot()
    {
        Statamic::inlineScript('window.Beacon("init", "abc123")');
    }
}
```
