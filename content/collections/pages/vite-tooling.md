## Files
We recommend using Vite to manage your addon's asset build process. To use Vite, you'll need the following files inside your addon.

``` files theme:serendipity-light
your-addon/
    resources/
        dist/
        js/
            addon.js
        css/
            addon.css
    src/
        ServiceProvider.php
    vite.config.js
    package.json
```

### package.json
Here's `package.json`, which contains the commands you'll need to run, and the dependencies needed to run Vite.

- The `laravel-vite-plugin` package allows a simpler wrapper around common Vite options, and provides hot reloading.
- The `@statamic/cms` package allows you to import Vue components from Statamic. As it's not a "real" npm package, the code is being pulled from your addon's `vendor` directory.

```json
{
    "private": true,
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "vite",
        "build": "vite build"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "@statamic/cms": "file:./vendor/statamic/cms/resources/dist-package"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "laravel-vite-plugin": "^1.2.0",
        "vite": "^6.3.4"
    }
}
```

### vite.config.js
Here's `vite.config.js`, which configures Vite itself.

- The Laravel Vite plugin defaults to the `public` directory to place the compiled code because it's intended to be used in your app. We've changed it to `resources/dist` as we think it's a nicer convention when using in an addon. Of course, you may customize it. Whichever directory you choose, you'll need to make sure it exists.
- The `statamic` plugin allows you to import Statamic's Vue components and CSS files.

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import laravel from 'laravel-vite-plugin';
import statamic from '@statamic/cms/vite-plugin';

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel({
            input: [
                'resources/js/addon.js',
                'resources/css/addon.css'
            ],
            publicDirectory: 'resources/dist',
        }),
        statamic(),
    ],
});
```

### Service Provider
Here's `ServiceProvider.php`, which is the PHP entry point to your addon. You should add a `$vite` property which mirrors the paths in your `vite.config.js` file.

```php
class ServiceProvider extends AddonServiceProvider
{
    protected $vite = [ // [tl! ++:start]
        'input' => [
            'resources/js/addon.js',
            'resources/css/addon.css',
        ],
        'publicDirectory' => 'resources/dist',
    ]; // [tl! ++:end]
}
```

:::tip
If you use the `php please make:fieldtype` command, these files will be created automatically for you.
:::

## Tailwind CSS

If you want to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) in your addon's views, you'll need to install & configure Tailwind.

1. First, install `tailwindcss`:
    ```sh
    npm install tailwindcss
    ```

3. In your addon's CSS file, import Statamic's `tailwind.css` file:
    ```css
    @import "@statamic/cms/tailwind.css";
    ```

    You don't need to `@import "tailwindcss"`, as it'll be imported by Statamic's `tailwind.css` file.

## Development

If you visit the Control Panel before running any commands, you will be greeted with a `Vite manifest not found` error. You'll need to install dependencies (the first time only) and start the development server.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now that the Vite server is running, the error in the Statamic CP should be gone once you refresh.

With the development server running, hot reloading should be working. When you save a CSS or JS file, it should be reflected in the browser without you needing to manually refresh.

:::tip
If you're using Valet with a secured site, your JS might not be loading correctly due to access control checks. You'll need Vite know about your Laravel site in `vite.config.js`.

```js
export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel({
            valetTls: 'yoursite.test', // [tl!++]
            input: [
```
:::

### Vue Devtools
Vue Devtools are disabled by default, for security reasons. 

Statamic provides an opt-in dev build, allowing you to use Vue Devtools and see un-minified code, useful when debugging custom Vue components.

Your app must have debug mode enabled:

```
APP_DEBUG=true
```

The dev build can either be published via the `vendor:publish` command:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=statamic-cp-dev
```

Alternatively, it can be symlinked:

```
ln -s /path/to/vendor/statamic/cms/resources/dist-dev public/vendor/statamic/cp-dev
```

Statamic will attempt to use the dev build as long as the `public/vendor/statamic/cp-dev` directory exists. You **shouldn't** commit these or use this on production.

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your addon, either to your own application or getting it ready to go into the marketplace, you should compile the production assets.

Make sure that the Vite dev server is not running, then run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The files will be compiled into `resources/dist`.

If you'd like to test that everything is working you can run `php artisan vendor:publish` in your app and choose your addon's tag. The compiled assets should be copied into `public/vendor/your-addon` and they should be loaded in the Control Panel.
